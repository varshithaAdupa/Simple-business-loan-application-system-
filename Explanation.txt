Building a simple business loan application system involves both frontend and backend development, as well as integration with third-party providers like the decision engine and accounting software providers. Here's a high-level overview of how you can structure this project:

Frontend:
You can choose to build a basic frontend using HTML/CSS or a more dynamic one using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js. Below is a simplified example using HTML and JavaScript:

Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, make API requests to the backend, and display results.

Backend:
You can choose a backend language/framework to create an API that communicates with the decision engine and accounting software providers. Below is a simplified example using Node.js and Express.js for the backend:

Install required packages:
You'll need packages like Express.js for creating the API endpoints, Axios for making HTTP requests, and other necessary packages. You can install them using npm:

npm install express axios
Configure Frontend:
In your frontend JavaScript (script.js), make AJAX requests to your backend API to submit the loan application and display the result.

This is a simplified outline of how you can structure your project. In a real-world scenario, you would need to replace placeholder URLs with actual endpoints for the decision engine and accounting software providers. Additionally, you may need to handle authentication, error handling, and other features depending on the requirements of your project.
